# coding-interviews
Hello if you're reading this!
I created this repository with my solutions/experiments with various questions I was told to expect in coding interviews, particularly for Google. 
I'm most familiar with C, and I found it hard to find good youtube videos with accompanying code for C, so please let me know if this helps you out!
Anything preceded by a number is an example problem from LeetCode https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/

Working code includes:
- MergeSort
- QuickSort
- 1TwoSum
- 2AddTwoNums

Work In Progress includes:
- HashTables
- 3LongestSub


The main things I *hope* to add in here are:
- HashTables
- Trees???
- Solutions to common NP complex problems like travelling salesman or knapsack problem
